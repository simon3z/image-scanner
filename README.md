# image-scanner

### About

The image-scanner is a multi-faceted scanner for CVEs in containers and images.  Upon scanning a container or image, it then produces a report of any vulnerabilities found.  The image-scanner uses openscap to determine any vulnerabilities.

The image-scanner can be run on the command line but it is designed to be driven by a Python client API via REST.  You can reference [the API description](API_README.md) for details on the API.  In fact, our primary use case is for it to be run as "middleware" where using provided APIs, the consumer can take the common output data and transform it into something useful for their environment or application.  The image-scanner can also run parallel scans to speed up results.

As of this writing, the image-scanner can only scan Red Hat Enterprise based containers and images due to the lack of openscap inputs for other distributions.

### Building the image-scanner image
Inside the git repository is a directory called docker which contains a docker file for RHEL and Fedora, named Dockerfile and Dockerfile.fedora respectively.  To build the Fedora image, simply running the following from the base git directory.

````
sudo docker build -t fedora-image-scanner -f docker/Dockerfile.fedora .

### Running the image-scanner
The image scanner can be run in two different ways: via commandline or via API.  We believe both ways, the image-scanner should be run within the confines of a container.  Our expectation is that after some time, running the Client API will be the preferred method.  Running the command line method will
be favored for simple, immediate checks.

#### Running the image-scanner as a daemon (default)
The default behavior of the image-scanner image is to run as a REST daemon intended to interact with the client APIs.  Use the atomic command to create and run a container based on the image-scanner image.

First, use atomic to 'install' the image.  This prepares the image to be run by adding /etc/image-scanner/image-scanner.conf file into your filesystem.  This file contains several editable attributes  for running the image-scanner.
````
[bbaude@localhost image-scanner]$ atomic install fedora-image-scanner
docker run --rm -it --privileged -v /etc/:/host/etc/ -e IMAGE=fedora-image-scanner -e NAME=fedora-image-scanner fedora-image-scanner sh /root/image-scanner/docker/image-scanner-install.sh

The image-scanner configuration file is located at /etc/image-scanner/image-scanner.conf with defaults.  You can change the port number and broadcasting IP in that file
````
Now you can run the image-scanner simply with the atomic command:
````
[bbaude@localhost image-scanner]$ atomic run fedora-image-scannerdocker
run -dt --privileged -v /proc/:/hostproc/ -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup -v /var/log:/var/log -v /tmp:/tmp -v /run:/run -v /var/lib/docker/devicemapper/metadata/:/var/lib/docker/devicemapper/metadata/ -v /dev/:/dev/ -v /etc/image-scanner/:/etc/image-scanner --env container=docker --net=host --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN fedora-image-scanner

````

#### Running the image-scanner from the command line inside the container
As mentioned earlier, you can run the image-scanner from the command line.  Firstly, we need the container ID of the image-scanner.

````
[bbaude@localhost image-scanner]$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
31f34f95915d        fedora-image-scanner   "/bin/sh -c /usr/bin   3 seconds ago       Up 2 seconds                            trusting_kirch
````
With the container ID, you can now use docker exec to 'enter' the container and run the image-scanner on the command line.

````
[bbaude@localhost image-scanner]$ atomic run 31f34f95915d /bin/bash
[image-scanner]#  docker_scanner.py -s bef54

#### Running the image-scanner using 'image-scanner-remote'
We also provide a command line utility that allows you to scan both local and remote hosts and it provides a basic summarized response.  The command name is 'image-scanner-remote'.  Run the command with the --help switch to see its syntax.

One very useful part of the image-scanner-remote tool is that it it has a switch where you can choose a profile defined in /etc/image-scanner/image-scanner-client.conf.  This allows you to simply switch from local host to another remote host and so on.  Here is an example of scanning an image on a remote, virtualized host.
````

### Building RPMs from the git tree

Once you have a checkout of the git repository, you can easily create RPMs from the git content.

First being by cleaning any clutter from previous builds.
````
[bbaude@localhost image-scanner]$ make clean
rm -fvr packaging/image-scanner-*
rm -fvr packaging/noarch
````
Now issue the make command to build RPMs.
````
[bbaude@localhost image-scanner]$ make -C packaging -f Makefile.dist-packaging rpm
make: Entering directory '/home/bbaude/docker/image-scanner/packaging'
set -x; \
echo "PACKAGE=image-scanner"; \
TARFILE_TMP=image-scanner-0f13ae0.tar.tmp; \
echo "Archiving image-scanner at $(git describe --always --tags)"; \

````
The RPMs will then be stored locally in the packaging/noarch directory.
````
